                Hello! My name is Akinyemi Borisade but, I go by Yemi to make it easier. I was born in Jacksonville, FL
                and
                happen to be the youngest of my 3 siblings. I would eventually graduate high school and attend the
                University of
                North Florida to obtain my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice. Soon after that I obtained my Master's in
                Criminal
                Justice and became a police officer.

            </p>

            <p>

                What started as a dream job turned into a dream differed as it became a career that was no longer for
                me.
                This
                brought me to the wonderful and limitless world of software development and engineering. I believe this
                is a
                field where I can truly show and devlop my talents further while aiding company practices.
